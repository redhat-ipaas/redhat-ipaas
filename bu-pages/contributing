<p>Pull requests are always welcome. Please be sure to read through this entire guide before opening up 
a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fork the repository you&rsquo;d like to collaborate on.</li>
<li>Clone your fork of that repository, NOT the original repository directly.</li>
<li>Follow instructions on the README.md of the repository to install any dependencies. This 
varies from repository to repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>

<p>These are guidelines for consistency and to make everyone&rsquo;s lives easier, but we welcome contributors of all levels of expertise and will work with you to try and follow these best practices. An open source community is just that - a community - not a panel of experts. :)</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please write unit tests for all of your code.</li>
<li>If you are contributing to the Client, please also add to the E2E tests as well.</li>
<li>Make sure all tests pass prior to creating a PR. If you make a PR with tests running and then make changes, please re-run those tests again just to be sure they are all passing with your new changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-prs">Creating PRs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please reference any GitHub issue relevant.</li>
<li>Add user readable descriptions of the changes this PR brings if merged in.</li>
<li>Screenshots are almost always helpful unless the changes are very minor or if it&rsquo;s just pure code. 
Use your judgment here. UI changes almost always translate into screenshots being helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get stuck at all, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us via the mailing list at ipaas-dev@redhat.com. Hope this helps!</p>
